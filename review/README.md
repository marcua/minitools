# GitHub PR Review Comments Extractor

A bookmarklet that extracts review comments from GitHub Pull Requests and copies them to your clipboard in Markdown format, ready to paste into your coding agent.

## Features

- 🎨 **Modal UI** - Shows comments in a nice modal with a textarea you can edit
- 📋 Extracts all unresolved review comments from a GitHub PR
- 📝 Formats comments in Markdown with file names and line numbers
- 🎯 Preserves comment structure (single-line and multi-line)
- ✂️ Copy button to copy all comments, or select/copy a subset
- 🔧 Easy to maintain with human-readable source code
- ✨ **Works with both GitHub interfaces** - Supports both the new React-based UI and the classic HTML interface

## Installation

1. Open `index.html` in your web browser
2. Drag the "📋 Extract PR Comments" link to your bookmarks bar
3. Alternatively, right-click the link and select "Add to Bookmarks"

## Usage

1. Navigate to a GitHub Pull Request
2. Click on the **Files changed** tab (side-by-side diff view)
3. Click the **📋 Extract PR Comments** bookmarklet in your bookmarks bar
4. A modal will appear with all comments in a textarea
5. Click **Copy to Clipboard** to copy everything, or select/highlight specific comments to copy just those
6. Paste the comments into your coding agent (or anywhere else)
7. Click **Close** or click outside the modal to dismiss it

## Output Format

The bookmarklet generates markdown in this format:

```markdown
# PR Review Comments

## product/site_builder/api_views/ai/views.py: line 42

This is a review comment on line 42

---

## product/site_builder/api_views/ai/views.py: lines 50-55

This is a review comment on lines 50-55. It might be
a multi-line comment or a suggestion to edit multiple lines.

```

## Customization

### Including Resolved Comments

By default, the bookmarklet only extracts **unresolved** comments. To include resolved comments:

1. Open `bookmarklet.src.js`
2. Find this section:

```javascript
// Skip resolved threads (optional - you can remove this if to include resolved comments)
if (thread.isResolved) {
  return;
}
```

3. Comment out or remove those lines
4. Run `python3 build.py` to rebuild the bookmarklet
5. Reload `index.html` and reinstall the bookmarklet

### Changing the Output Format

The markdown format is defined in the `formatAsMarkdown()` function in `bookmarklet.src.js`. You can customize:

- The heading levels
- The line number format
- Whether to include author names
- Whether to include timestamps

After making changes, run `python3 build.py` to rebuild.

## Development

### Project Structure

```
review/
├── bookmarklet.src.js   # Human-readable source code
├── build.py             # Build script that minifies the bookmarklet
├── index.html     # Generated HTML with bookmarklet link (do not edit directly)
└── README.md            # This file
```

### Making Changes

1. Edit `bookmarklet.src.js` (the human-readable source)
2. Run the build script:
   ```bash
   python3 build.py
   ```
3. Open `index.html` in your browser
4. Reinstall the bookmarklet by dragging it to your bookmarks bar again

### How It Works

The bookmarklet automatically detects which GitHub interface you're using:

**New Interface (React-based)**:
1. Extracts the JSON payload from GitHub's React app (embedded in a `<script>` tag)
2. Parses the `threads` object containing all review comments
3. Matches thread IDs with file paths and line numbers from `diffSummaries`
4. Filters out resolved threads (optional)
5. Formats the comments as Markdown

**Classic Interface (HTML-based)**:
1. Finds all review thread DOM elements (`.review-thread-component`)
2. Extracts file paths, line numbers, and comment text from the HTML structure
3. Parses suggestion diffs from the rendered HTML
4. Filters out resolved threads (optional)
5. Formats the comments as Markdown

**Both interfaces**:
6. Show a modal with an editable textarea
7. Provide a copy button to copy all comments to clipboard

### Testing

To test changes:

1. Make your edits to `bookmarklet.src.js`
2. Run `python3 build.py`
3. Open a GitHub PR with review comments
4. Click the Files changed tab
5. Click the updated bookmarklet
6. Verify the output

## Troubleshooting

### "Could not find GitHub PR data"

Make sure you're on the **Files changed** tab of a Pull Request, not the Conversation tab.

### "No unresolved review comments found"

Either:
- There are no review comments on this PR, or
- All comments have been marked as resolved

If you want to extract resolved comments, see the "Including Resolved Comments" section above.

### Comments are missing

Some possible causes:
- Comments might be marked as resolved (see customization section)
- The GitHub PR page structure might have changed (file an issue if this happens)

### Clipboard copy fails

The bookmarklet requires a modern browser with Clipboard API support. Make sure you're using:
- Chrome/Edge 66+
- Firefox 63+
- Safari 13.1+

## Browser Compatibility

- ✅ Chrome/Edge (tested)
- ✅ Firefox (tested)
- ✅ Safari (should work)

## License

Free to use and modify for personal or commercial use.
